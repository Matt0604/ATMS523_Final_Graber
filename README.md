My submission for ATMS 523 Final during the Fall 2025 semester. 

# Description
It was our job to create a frost risk model for a strawberry farm in Plant City, Florida. In part 1, we illustrated the mean risk of frost and freezes during the October-January months from 1991-2020 by plotting the mean number of days over time with a minimum temperature less than or equal to 32 and 28 degrees, respectively. Doing so demonstrated that risk is highest in January at the end of the growing season, but the risk is still relatively low because the temperature rarely get this cold this far south. 
We then determined that the NINO1+2 index was the most optimal since it had the highest pearson correlation of the four ENSO indices. The correlation was not terribly high since there are not many days that get below 28 degrees in Plant City. 

Strawberry farmers in Plant City, Florida should remain cautious especially during months where the NINO index is < 0, based on the negative Pearson correlation. They should be comforted by the fact however that climatology in this region seems to suggest that the temperature rarely gets this low regardless.
